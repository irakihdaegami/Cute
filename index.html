                Hehehe remember this? My cutie we have come so far. Literally also amoiiii. But this is not a senti farewell letter. This is me wishing my princess A VERY HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYYYYYYYYYY. Happy birthday mero mutu. I love you to the moon and back baby. My bestfriend is 23 years young today. So mature and strong. I am extremely proud of you mutu. I know we have felt distant and we are very far but I am always there for you maya. I will always be by your side no matter what. I know aile samma pachi basic nai bhairacha mero side bata tara daami daami garne din aaudai cha ajhai hehehe. We have a lot of things to look forward to and I have a lot of love to give you. And you are the one who taught me how to give someone all this love. I have never loved anyone the way I love you and I don‚Äôt intend to love anyone else. You are my one and only. You are my happiness. You are the reason for me trying to be a better version of myself. Ma estai chu bhanera bhane pani I don‚Äôt mean it promiseeeeeeee. I will always be a better person for you baby. I will always improve my habits and always try to do better. You are way toooooooo special for me to not be a better version of myself. I know yo birthday ma hami tadha cham and you‚Äôre probably missing me a lot. I miss celebrating our birthdays together maya. I miss you. I miss you smiling. I miss you being aashey baccha and expecting cakes and gifts for your birthday. I miss you from that aashey baccha to your last birthday when you were so mature and siilently celebrating your birthday. I love both versions of you. But I like the aashey baccha expecting gifts and words of affirmation. So here is the word of affirmation for my cutie. 
                YOU ARE THE BESTTTTTTTTTTTTT SONIYA. You have been a blessing for me. Everything is soo soo soo much better when I‚Äôm with you. I know we expect a lot out of each other and we try our best to give each other everything we can. Kaile kai nasake pani, we usually do. And I promise to always give you the best. I promise to always love you the most. I promise to keep my promise. I promise to always have my ring with me hehehe. I promise to celebrate a 100 more birthdays with you baby. I will love you forever Sona Imu Adhikari. And I will always celebrate your birthdays no matter how near or far we are. Happy birthday once again my princess. I hope you have a great one. Imu loves you.
